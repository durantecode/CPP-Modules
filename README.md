# CPP-Modules

The goal of this C++ modules is to introduce us into Object Oriented Programming (finally).
All the exercises cover the main basic stuff... Std namespace, member fuctions, classes, inheritance, polymorphism, exceptions, templates... etc.

Pretty good exercises and tons of new material.
